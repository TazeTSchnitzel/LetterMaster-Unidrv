*% I went through it, feature by feature, and added each to this file where
*% applicable to the LetterMaster.
*% See: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff556567%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

*% Root-Level-Only Attributes
*% ==========================

*ModelName: "Royal LetterMaster"

*GPDFileName: "LetterMaster.gpd"
*% This is the version of the file format itself
*GPDSpecVersion: "1.0"
*% Whereas this is the version of this specific file
*GPDFileVersion: "0.1"

*% Master units in GPD files are fractions of an inch
*% It should be the lowest common multiple of your various units

*% Page B-2 in the LetterMaster manual states that
*% columns per line is 66 characters/line at 1/10", or 80 at 1/12"
*% So our horizontal unit is 1/60" (the LCM of 10 and 12)

*% Page 1-7 says that a single line feed is 1/6" and a 1-1/2 line feed is 1/4"
*% So our vertical unit is 1/12" (the LCM of 4 and 6)
*MasterUnits: PAIR(60, 12)

*ModelName: "Royal LetterMaster"

*% I don't actually know why it's TTY vs PAGE or SERIAL
*% But that's what the Generic / Text Only driver does, and it works
*PrinterType: TTY

*% Page B-1 claims a print speed of 10 CPS (characters per second)
*PrintRate: 10
*PrintRateUnit: CPS

*% General Printing Attributes
*% ===========================

*% Printer Capability Attributes
*% -----------------------------

*% The LetterMaster supports bold (i.e. double-weight) and underline
*TextCaps: LIST(TC_SA_DOUBLE, TC_UA_ABLE)

*% Color Attributes
*% ----------------

*% None applicable.

*% Cursor Attributes
*% -----------------

*% The LetterMaster has a pretty big built-in margin: the print head can't
*% cover the full horizontal width of the paper, only a smaller printable
*% area. The manual says on page B-2 that the "print line width" is 6.6".
*% Because of this inherent margin, after a carriage return, the head is
*% at the "printable x origin". There's no further left it can go.
*CursorXAfterCR: AT_PRINTABLE_X_ORIGIN

*% As specified page 3-3, Form Feed will make the printer feed out the page
*% I assume that's what Microsoft mean by "eject".
*EjectPageWithFF?: TRUE

*% The maximum line spacing seems to be 1-1/2 (unless you fake 2 with NLs)
*% Page 1-6 says a 1-1/2 line spacing is 1/4"
*% Our master vertical unit is 1/12", so we put 3/12"
*% FIXME: What if line spacing is set to 1 on the Control Panel?
*% Should this be a conditional block?
*MaxLineSpacing: 3

*% MS documentation states:
*% > If TRUE, Unidrv uses spaces for coarse moves and NULLs for fine moves.
*% > If FALSE, Unidrv uses NULLs for all moves.
*% LetterMaster manual page 3 states that NUL and DEL are ignored
*% If by "ignored" they mean "print head isn't even moved", then we have a 
*% problem if Windows outputs NULs. It might just mean it doesn't do anything
*% special, but I'll be careful. So TRUE it is.
*UseSpaceForXMove?: TRUE

*% I'm not certain, but I guess that I should "favor LF spacing" here
*YMoveAttributes: LIST(FAV_LF)

*% Text Printing Attributes
*% ========================

*% None of this stuff seems applicable.

*% Raster Printing Attributes
*% ==========================

*% None of this stuff seems applicable.

*% Vector Printing Attributes
*% ==========================

*% None of this stuff seems applicable.

*% General Printing Commands
*% =========================

*% Fun fact: all the LetterMaster's commands are copied from the Diable 630!
*% Since it was a very popular daisy wheel printer, most daisy wheel printers
*% released after it had Diablo 630 emulation. The LetterMaster, from what I
*% can tell, does not profess this ability anywhere in the manual. But it is
*% clear that the LetterMaster's entire command set is a subset of the 630's.
*% See: http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page_description_languages/diablo_630

*% Color Commands
*% --------------

*% None of this stuff seems applicable.

*% Cursor Commands
*% ---------------

*% The LetterMaster doesn't really have proper cursor commands beyond your 
*% typical BS/CR/FF/LF, and space of course.
*% It does support "half-line forward" (page 3-4 and page 3-7) but Windows
*% does not appear to support such a thing, only relative commands (i.e.
*% "go X units down"), unfortunately.

*% Page 3-3 says ASCII BS (0x08), CR (0x0D), FF (0x0C) and LF (0x0A) supported
*% They do exactly what you expect them to.

*Command: CmdBackSpace: "<08>"
*Command: CmdCR: "<0D>"
*Command: CmdFF: "<0C>"
*Command: CmdLF: "<0A>"

*% Printer Configuration Commands
*% ==============================

*% The LetterMaster is pretty plain and simple here! Nothing special needed for
*% starting or ending printing. ^^

*% Option Selection Commands
*% =========================

*% The LetterMaster has no special options, at least not of the kind requiring
*% special data to be sent from the PC.

*% Text Printing Commands
*% ======================

*% Commands for Device Fonts
*% -------------------------

*% There's a section for this in the manual, but no such things exist. Huh?

*% Commands for Downloaded Fonts
*% -----------------------------

*% None of this stuff seems applicable.

*% Commands for Simulated Fonts
*% -----------------------------

*% I don't really know if the the print wheel typeface is a "simulated font".
*% Microsoft don't seem to define that anywhere. But it seems applicable.
*% And this is the place where all the formatting stuff seems to be.

*% In case you're wondering: 0x1B is ASCII's ESC (escape) character.
*% And yes, as mentioned earlier, all these are the same as on the Diablo 630.

*% Bold on and off, see page 3-4 and page 3-8
*Command: CmdBoldOff: "<1B>&"
*Command: CmdBoldOn: "<1B>O"

*% Underline on and off, see page 3-4 and page 3-7
*Command: CmdUnderlineOff: "<1B>R"
*Command: CmdUnderlineOn: "<1B>E"

*% Raster Printing Commands
*% ========================

*% The LetterMaster doesn't support raster images.
*% This is a bit of a shame, really. The Diablo 630 did, albeit very slowly.
*% Well, you get what you pay for.

*% Vector Printing Commands
*% ========================

*% The LetterMaster doesn't support vector images.

*% Standard Features
*% =================

*% From what I can see, MANUAL is the only applicable paper feed type.
*Feature: InputBin
{
    *Option: MANUAL
    {
        *% You're supposed to use localisable strings.
        *% But let's be honest here: I'm not going to write a resource DLL.
        *% Nor do I need one, this is only ever going to be in English.
        *Name: "Manual paper feed"

        *% There isn't really a "command" for this, but we MUST specify one.
        *% So we make a useless one.
        *Command: CmdSelect
        {
            *Order: JOB_SETUP.100
            *Cmd: ""
        }
    }
}

*% The LetterMaster doesn't really support landscape printing ;)
*Feature: Orientation
{
    *Option: PORTRAIT
    {
        *Name: "Portrait"

        *% There isn't really a "command" for this, but we MUST specify one.
        *% So we leave it blank.
        *Command: CmdSelect
        {
            *Order: JOB_SETUP.100
            *Cmd: ""
        }
    }
}

*% The LetterMaster supports 8" and 8.5" widths (page 1-3)
*% Windows only has the 8.5"x11" size US Letter built-in, there's no 8" size
*% Presumably 8" would be the ancient Government Letter size which is now
*% obsolete.
*% FIXME: Add Government Letter size.
*Feature: PaperSize
{
    *Option: LETTER
    {
        *Name: "Letter"
        
        *% There isn't really a "command" for this, but we MUST specify one.
        *% So we leave it blank.
        *Command: CmdSelect
        {
            *Order: JOB_SETUP.100
            *Cmd: ""
        }

        *% Oh girl, fun fun fun here.
        *% The LetterMaster has a fixed minimum top and left margin, due to
        *% the short width of the printer. So we must define the printable
        *% area with this in mind.

        *% This is basically defined by our margins.

        *% We know that US Letter is 8.5"x11".
        *% Page B-2 of the manual claims a print line width of 6.6".
        *% Looking at the margins shown on the ruler, the left margin is
        *% 10 chars at 10cpi, or 12 chars at 12 cpi, so 1".
        *% 8.5" - 1" - 6.6" = .9", so that is our right margin.

        *% The top margin isn't specified anywhere, and that's because there is
        *% none. If you're using continuous feed paper, you can probably put 
        *% it in such that it'd start printing right at the top of it. But,
        *% if you're using a cut sheet, you basically have to have a top margin
        *% of about 1", because of the gap between the paper bail and actual
        *% print head.
        *% Similarly, there's no minimum bottom margin. But beyond about 1"
        *% from the bottom of the page, the LetterMaster will have difficulty
        *% moving a cut sheet properly for line spacing.
        *% So, we'll pretend the top and bottom margins are 1". Therefore our
        *% vertical area is 11" - 1" - 1" = 9"

        *% So, to recap:
        *% Area: 6.6"x9"
        *% Printable origin (left/top margin): (1", 1")

        *% Our master horizontal unit is 1/60", so we put 396/60"
        *% Our master vertical unit is 1/12", so we put 108/12"
        *PrintableArea: PAIR(396, 108)

        *% Our master horizontal unit is 1/60", so we put 60/60"
        *% Our master vertical unit is 1/12", so we put 12/12"
        *PrintableOrigin: PAIR(60, 12)
    }
}

*% Windows has no built-in resolutions, you must make them custom. Woop. :/
*% For now let's just assume 12cpi pitch and invent a nonsense DPI.
*% It's not like the LetterMaster actually supports raster or vector graphics.
*% FIXME: Support 10cpi pitch too.
*Feature: Resolution
{
    *Option: 10cpi
    {
        *Name: "10cpi"

        *% As before, we need to specify some command. This is controlled by
        *% a switch, not a command, so we leave it blank.
        *Command: CmdSelect
        {
            *Order: JOB_SETUP.100
            *Cmd: ""
        }

        *DPI: PAIR(300, 300)
        *TextDPI: PAIR(300, 300)
    }
}

*% Customized Features
*% ===================

*% This is probably where the 1 or 1-1/2 line spacing and 10 or 12 cpi pitch
*% options should be handled. Maybe. I'm not sure.
*% FIXME: Do those.
